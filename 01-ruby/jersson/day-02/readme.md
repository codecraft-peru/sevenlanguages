# Learning Ruby - Day 02
## To find

- Find out how to access files with and without code blocks. What is the benefit of the code block? [[more info](https://www.rubyguides.com/2015/05/working-with-files-ruby/)]

- How would you translate a hash to an array? [[more info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4591949/converting-ruby-hashes-to-arrays)] 

- Can you translate arrays to hashes? [[more info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39567/what-is-the-best-way-to-convert-an-array-to-a-hash-in-ruby)]

- Can you iterate through a hash? [[more info](https://riptutorial.com/ruby/example/5235/iterating-over-a-hash)]

- You can use Ruby arrays as stacks. What other common data structures do arrays support? [[more info](https://medium.com/amiralles/mastering-data-structures-in-ruby-recap-682a698b90d0)]

## To do

- Print the contents of an array of sixteen numbers, four numbers at a time, using just **each**. Now, do the same with **each_slice** in **Enumerable**. [[solution](./ex-01.rb)]


- The Tree class was interesting, but it did not allow you to specify a new tree with a clean user interface. Let the initializer accept a nested structure of hashes. You should be able to specify a tree like this: *{’grandpa’ => { ’dad’ => {’child 1’ => {}, ’child 2’ => {} }, ’uncle’ => {’child 3’ => {}, ’child 4’ => {} }}}*. [[solution](./ex-02.rb)]

- Write a simple grep that will print the lines of a file having any occurrences of a phrase anywhere in that line. You will need to do a simple regular expression match and read lines from a file. (This is surprisingly simple in Ruby.) If you want, include line numbers. [[solution](./ex-03/ex-03.rb)]
