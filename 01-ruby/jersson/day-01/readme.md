## To do
- Print the string “Hello, world.”
- For the string “Hello, Ruby,” find the index of the word “Ruby.”
- Print your name ten times. 
- Print the string “This is sentence number 1,” where the number 1 changes from 1 to 10.
- Run a Ruby program from a file.
- **Bonus problem:** If you’re feeling the need for a little more, write a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.
