# Seven Languages
In Seven quarantines :)
<br/>Based on the info and exercises in the book [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/seven-languages-in/9781680500059/)

## Languages
- Ruby
    - Jersson's project [[link](./01-ruby/jersson)]
- Io
- Prolog
- Scala
- Erlang
- Clojure
    - Alex's project [[link](./06-clojure/alex)]
- Haskell

## Source code folder structure
```
.\0{language-number}-{language-name}
----\crafter-name
-------\day-0{day-number}
----------\ex-0{ex-number}.{extension} 
```

If any exercise solution needs more than one file you must create a folder, otherwise you can use a single file for solve it. The folder name has to use the structure **ex-0{ex-number}**
